I am currently the Herbert and Florence Irving Professor
of Cancer Data Research (in the Herbert and Florence Irving Institute
of Cancer Dynamics and in the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer
Center) and Professor of <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/">Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Computer Science</a> at Columbia University. 

<br>

Prior to arriving at Columbia, I was a <a
href="https://www.math.utexas.edu/~blumberg/">professor</a> in the
math department at UT-Austin.

Before that, I was an NSF postdoctoral fellow from 2005-2009 at
Stanford, with a year's stint as a member at the Institute for
Advanced Study in 2007-2008.

And even before that, I was a graduate student in at the University of
Chicago, where I finished a Ph.D. in 2005 under the supervision of
<a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may">Peter May</a> and <a href="https://mmandell.pages.iu.edu/">Michael Mandell</a>.
